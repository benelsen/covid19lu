# Covid-19 Luxembourg
## aggregated dataset of publicly available data on Covid-19 in Luxembourg

Updated daily, usually by 18:00 local time (no promises).

There's currently no public documentation available (lack of interest v. investment needed).
Most filenames and columns should be self-descriptive and if you have questions you can file an issue here or mail to [data@donneeen.lu](mailto:data@donneeen.lu).

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for major updates to the data structure and columns.
