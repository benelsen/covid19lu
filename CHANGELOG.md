# Changelog

## 2021-01-23

- All files having breakdowns by age will be removed from the `of_date` folders (i.e. `active_age.csv`, `deaths_age.csv`, `hospital_intensive_age.csv`, `hospital_normal_age.csv`) shortly.
    They don't have any use as the main files contain the same data and there no source for past values.
